# Emotion-Recognition

Dataset has been taken from :: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

The model uses Convolutional Neural Network of 3 layers implemented using keras, which classifies it into seven different emotions - 'angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'sad', 'surprise', 'neutral'. Also, loss function used is 'cross entropy' because the task is multi class classification.
